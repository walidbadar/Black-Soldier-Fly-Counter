<p>Background and Rationale:</p>
<p>Waste processing by Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae is seen as a promising organic waste treatment
technology, due to the high waste reduction potential while producing valuable products. Young BSF
larvae are placed on organic waste where they feed for about two weeks, reducing the biomass by up
to 70%. The grown larvae will be harvested and sold as a component of animal feed for fish and poultry
or pet food.</p>
<p>For waste treatment, trays are filled with substrate and stocked with a clearly defined number of
young larvae. The production of stocking larvae in constant quality and quantity is therefore a crucial
point in every BSF facility. For the production of young larvae, a nursery is operated with nets in which
the flies mate and lay eggs. These nets, the so-called love cages, are temporarily connected to other
nets (dark cages) from where flies fly into the love cages. The number of these flies should be counted
with a sensor.</p>
